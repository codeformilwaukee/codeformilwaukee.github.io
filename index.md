        <p>Code for Milwaukee is a <a href="http://brigade.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America Brigade</a> located here in Milwaukee, WI. Founded in 2019, we are a group of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues and help people engage with the city. We host monthly hacknights and other events to gather, discuss, and get stuff done.</p>
        <p>We're looking to bring people with all different skill sets together to maximize our potential. Civic hackers aren't just developers — they're journalists, lawyers, designers, and interested citizens in general. The more community participation, the better.</p>
        <p>To contact us, please email <a href="mailto:team@codeformilwaukee.org">team@codeformilwaukee.org</a>.</p>
