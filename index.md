        <p>Our Hack Nights are events where we share knowledge about our city and how to make it better. We invite anyone to visit to learn, or to find out how they can help to make an impact. Hack Nights are part community building, part hack-a-thon, and if you're interested in any of the above please join us, visit <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qysSk4LITm0CmbQ-KmFZ8wn2umnEZgd7DrXJJhVs6XY/edit?usp=drivesdk">here</a> to get started, or contact us at <a href="mailto:info@codeformilwaukee.org">info@codeformilwaukee.org</a></p>
