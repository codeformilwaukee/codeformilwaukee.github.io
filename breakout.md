    <p>Every week after the presentation, we break out into topic-specific working and learning groups led by regular facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps. The groups are split into two types: <a href='#working'>working</a> groups and <a href='#learning'>learning</a> groups.</p>

    <p>

      <p>These groups focus on building civic apps, doing research and pursuing ways of using technology to make Milwaukee a better place to live in. Groups can last for one night or several years - it's up to you!</p>

        <div id="closed-groups" class="usa-accordion-content">
          <p>Sometimes groups get marked as <code>closed</code> if they haven't been active in a few weeks. This is to keep the list size managable. Any group marked this way can be re-opened at any time.</p>

          <p>To re-open a group:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Visit the <a href='https://github.com/codeformilwaukee/breakout-groups/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed' target='_blank'>list of closed Github Issues</a>.</li>
            <li>Search for your project and click on it.</li>
            <li>You will see all the project notes and comments previously left. Scroll to the bottom of the page you'll see a box that allows you to leave a comment. Next to the comment button there should be a 'Reopen Issue' button. </li>
            <li>We recommend leaving a comment while you re-open the issue, to update the project and mention if you're looking for anything new!</li>
