NexTo was created to support  projects that provide community members and essential workers with PPE and other supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Community organizations spend a significant amount of time and energy planning, organizing, and executing efforts to respond to time-sensitive community needs and crisis situations. This work of the social sector is critically important, but unnecessarily inefficient. NexTo helps the social sector become more rapid and efficient than traditional direct service models, and enables organizations to make a positive impact at scale.
