The City has an open data portal, however, usage is fairly low and visits are generally made by a fairly homogeneous group of users (those with a certain level of technical prowess and ready-made ideas for how local open data may be useful to them). The opportunity is to increase the accessibility, responsiveness, and broad appeal for this potentially invaluable tool.
